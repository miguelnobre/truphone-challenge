2. Full API implemented, respecting REST standards and working
3. Clean code following best practices and using common Design Patterns
4. Efficient code
5. Reasonable Unit Test coverage
6. API documented with OpenAPI or similar
7. API documented in word processing document (if 6. not present)
8. Manual tests present
9. Regular commits on project milestones

11. Docker Compose file present
12. Kubernetes files present
13. Any extra artefacts the candidate deems important or relevant

## General Advice to Candidate

1. Read all before starting

## Description of the Challenge

### Write a REST service that supports the management of family trees

### Represented entities

1. Family
  * Family name
  * Code of country of origin (ISO 3166-1)
2. Family member
  * Family identifier (if family known)
  * First name
  * Middle name
  * Last name
  * Father identifier
  * Mother identifier
  * Spouse identifier
  * Date of birth

#### Supported operations

1. Add family
2. Get family by identifier
3. List all families
4. Update family (full and partial)
5. Delete a family (error if not empty)
6. Search families by country code
7. Add a family member
8. Get Family member by identifier
9. search family members by Family
10. Update a family member (full and partial)
11. Delete a family member (error if has children)
12. Find family with highest accumulated age
  * Return identifier and total age
  * If 2 or more with same accumulated age:
    * Choose additional ordering criteria
    * Apply criteria
    * Document criteria
13. Find fastest growing family (family with best number of members/time ratio)
  * Time is total time since birth of first member till birth of last member
  * Return identifier and ratio
  * If 2 or more with same ratio:
    * Choose additional ordering criteria
    * Apply criteria
    * Document criteria
14. Find possible duplicates
  * Two family members (FM1 and FM2) are possible duplicates if
    * Are in the same Family
    * Have one name in common (one of the names o FM1 is equal to one of the names of FM2)
    * Have a similar date of birth
    * Each two corresponding ancestors (for example mother of FM1 vs mother of mother of FM2) are either:
      * The same (same id)
      * Missing (in FM1, FM2 or both)
      * Possible duplicates
